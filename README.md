[My Notes](notes.md)

CougarGrub is meant to be a web application that is optimized for mobile usage that allows users (BYU students) to upload details of free food (location, type of food, etc.) to the website where other users will be notified.

### Elevator pitch

Food is a basic necessity for human life, and as a college student, it can be quite scarce. Fortunately, BYU's campus can be a treasure trove of free food opportunities. Unfortunately, any student's ability to take advantage of these opportunities is limited to mere chance. CougarGrub enables students not only to captilize on these opportunities, but share with others. Ultimately we don't just want full stomachs, but united communities.

### Design

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Poster
    actor Website
    actor Other Students
    Poster->>Website: Post free food event (location, type, image)
    Website->>Other Students: Notify of new food event
    Other Students->>Website: View event details
```

### Key features

- secure log in features
- location and image tagging for new free food events
- live updates for new food events

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Provides the structural pages of the site: the feed of active food postings, a form for submitting a new food event (location, food type, image), and user profile/login pages.
- **CSS** - Styles the mobile-first layout so the feed of food postings, event cards, and forms look clean and usable on a phone screen 
- **React** - Builds the interactive front end as components with routing between pages like Home, Post Event, and Profile, and reactive state so the feed updates without a full page reload.
- **Service** -  A backend exposes endpoints for creating/fetching food postings, handling login/registration, and calling a third-party API (Google Maps API: https://mapsplatform.google.com/lp/maps-apis/)
- **DB/Login** - stores user accounts and food event data, and supports authenticated endpoints so only logged-in students can post and view
- **WebSocket** - makes live updates possible so a page refresh isn't required every time a new posting is submitted
